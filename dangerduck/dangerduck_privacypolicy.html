<h1>Dunally Software - Danger Duck - Privacy Policy<h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Danger Duck is a simple arcade game for people who want to improve their Spanish vocabulary in a fun way.  Dunally Software has developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose and transfer your information.  By using the application, you consent to the privacy practices described here; please take a moment to familiarise yourself with these practices.
<h2>Data Storage -  Dunally Software</h2>
<p>Dunally Software does not have access to any of your data.  The app does not communicate with any Dunally Software servers.</p>
<h2>Speech to Text</h2>

This typically happens on your device, but some devices may send the text of the Spanish words to third-party services to provide Speech to Text functionality.  By installing the app you consent to sending only this text where necessary.  Data storage issues don't arise here, this text originates in the app (i.e., it is not data that you have provided).</p>
