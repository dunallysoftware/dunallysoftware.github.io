<body>
<h1>Dunally Software - Palabras Ocultas - Privacy Policy<h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Palabras Ocultas is a word search game for people who want to improve their Spanish vocabulary.  Dunally Software has developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose and transfer your information.  By using the application, you consent to the privacy practices described here; please take a moment to familiarise yourself with these practices.
<h2>Data Storage -  Dunally Software</h2>
<p>Dunally Software does not have access to any of your data.  The app does not communicate with any Dunally Software servers.</p>
<h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
<p>Palabras Ocultas allows you to attempt to press a button and speak a Spanish word to search for it in the word grid.  When you do this, your speech is sent to Google for speech recognition processing; Google returns the text to the app.  We do not store your speech or the result.  If you use this functionality you consent to sending your speech to Google for this processing.  The app requires the "Record Audio" Android permission to provide this functionality.</p>
<h2>Speech to Text</h2>
<p>Palabras Ocultas uses Android Speech to Text to read out Spanish words.  This typically happens on your device, but some devices may send the text of the Spanish words to third-party services to provide Speech to Text functionality.  By installing the app you consent to sending only this text where necessary.  Data storage issues don't arise here, this text originates in the app (i.e., it is not data that you have provided).</p> 
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>Palabras Ocultas includes third-party banner advertisements.  These advertisements come from Google AdMob, and are subject to Google's privacy policy, which you can see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">here.</a2></p>
